# Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Networks

## Overview

This project implements a breast cancer classification model using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to classify tumors as either benign or malignant based on various features extracted from breast cancer biopsy samples. The project utilizes a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a neural network model that can accurately classify breast cancer tumors based on a dataset of features. The model is trained on a well-known breast cancer dataset and evaluated for its performance in predicting tumor types.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which contains 569 samples with 30 features each. The features represent various measurements related to the tumors, and the target variable indicates whether the tumor is benign (0) or malignant (1).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
